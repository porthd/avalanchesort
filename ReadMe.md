# general
`avalanchesort` is a sorting method, which should be better than mergesort or quicksort.
The algorithimn is independ to the form of storage and the form of the datas. 
The storage-handler only must define the methods, defined by the inferface `DataListAvalancheSortInterface.php`.  
In den documentation will you find a german description to the general idea of this algoriothmn.


## installation 
Use sh-script on console via ddev-console, to start the composer.
I use phpstorm for executing the unittests.
